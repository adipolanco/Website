            8/23/23 - This week I learned how to use what I learned in Physics last year about momentum and speed and apply it to a challenge. <br>
                      Our challenge was to make a marble travel as long as we can make it travel for by using sticks and by not allowing for it <br>
                      to move backwards, stop, or be touched by anyone's hands. We eventually got close enough to the bucket and the marble    <br>
                      almost went in. I also learned how to code a bit because we had to make our own websites and code it to look the way we <br>
                      want it to. I learned various controls in order to add a header, add a indent in a paragraph, etc. I had a lot of fun this <br>
                      week especially since I like the hands on work.
