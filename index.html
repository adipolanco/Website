            8/21/23-8/24/23 Week 1 <br>
             This week I learned how to use what I learned in Physics last year about momentum and speed and apply it to a challenge. <br>
             Our challenge was to make a marble travel as long as we can make it travel for by using sticks and by not allowing for it <br>
             to move backwards, stop, or be touched by anyone's hands. We eventually got close enough to the bucket and the marble    <br>
             almost went in. I also learned how to code a bit because we had to make our own websites and code it to look the way we <br>
             want it to. I learned various controls in order to add a header, add a indent in a paragraph, etc. I had a lot of fun this <br>
             week especially since I like the hands on work.

             8/28/23-9/1/23 Week 2 <br>
             This week I learned how to use the website TinkerCad. It is a website that lets us design and computer generate our plans  <br>
             for whatever project we are doing. For our challenege today, we had to create a home appliance using the shapes and controls. <br>
             So I had to flatten out shapes, add text, rotate the shapes, and manuever the things in general so I could create the buttons <br>
             on a microwave. I had a lot of fun using TinkerCad since it lets me be creative and I feel smart CAD'ing. </p>

            9/5/23-9/8/23 Week 3 <br>
            This week my team and I designed our first engineering project on TinkerCad. We had to make it to scale and that was when we <br>
            realized our project will end up being pretty big. My team and I also started constructing our project that we hope will pop <br>
            a ballon as the end goal. We made measurmentsm using a ruler before cutting the cardboard pieces out so we knew we were making <br>
            the most of our materials. I had a lot of fun becasue I like the hands on work in this class and the collaborativeness it promotes.

            9/11/23-9/15/23 Week 4 <br>
            This was the week we tested our Rube Goldberg design project. We are pretty excited because it worked and the car did fall into <br>
            the see-saw pushing the needle up and popping the balloon. At first, our project did not pop the balloon because our needle was <br>
            too far and back and the ballon was not blown up enough. The construction of our project was also fun because we had to cut out <br>
            all the pieces from cardboard and use duct tape to put them together. I had a good time working with my team and we were all <br>
            very cooperative.
