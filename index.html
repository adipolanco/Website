            8/21/23-8/24/23 Week 1 <br>
             This week I learned how to use what I learned in Physics last year about momentum and speed and apply it to a challenge. <br>
             Our challenge was to make a marble travel as long as we can make it travel for by using sticks and by not allowing for it <br>
             to move backwards, stop, or be touched by anyone's hands. We eventually got close enough to the bucket and the marble    <br>
             almost went in. I also learned how to code a bit because we had to make our own websites and code it to look the way we <br>
             want it to. I learned various controls in order to add a header, add a indent in a paragraph, etc. I had a lot of fun this <br>
             week especially since I like the hands on work.

             8/28/23-9/1/23 Week 2 <br>
             This week I learned how to use the website TinkerCad. It is a website that lets us design and computer generate our plans  
             for whatever project we are doing. For our challenege today, we had to create a home appliance using the shapes and controls. 
             So I had to flatten out shapes, add text, rotate the shapes, and manuever the things in general so I could create the buttons 
             on a microwave. I had a lot of fun using TinkerCad since it lets me be creative and I feel smart CAD'ing.

            9/5/23-9/8/23 Week 3 <br>
            This week my team and I designed our first engineering project on TinkerCad. We had to make it to scale and that was when we 
            realized our project will end up being pretty big. My team and I also started constructing our project that we hope will pop 
            a ballon as the end goal. We made measurmentsm using a ruler before cutting the cardboard pieces out so we knew we were making 
            the most of our materials. I had a lot of fun becasue I like the hands on work in this class and the collaborativeness it promotes.

            9/11/23-9/15/23 Week 4 <br>
            This was the week we tested our Rube Goldberg design project. We are pretty excited because it worked and the car did fall into 
            the see-saw pushing the needle up and popping the balloon. At first, our project did not pop the balloon because our needle was 
            too far and back and the ballon was not blown up enough. The construction of our project was also fun because we had to cut out 
            all the pieces from cardboard and use duct tape to put them together. I had a good time working with my team and we were all 
            very cooperative.

                I learned about Electrical Engineering in class today and I am actually interested it. With the coding we have done in class with
                our websites I feel more comfortable with it everyay and I enjoy it. On Tuesday we also did some challenges, a flotation device
                challenege and then a designing challenege. I made my boat with a base and rafters on the bottom and it actually floated
                for the full 5 minutes. We also designed the letter E to ensure we could give correct and accurate measurements.

                9/25/23-9/29/23 Week 6
                This week we took apart a computer and identified the parts. We had to be realy careful and make sure nothing was broken or 
                damaged. We took out the fan, the GPU and the Disk Drive before we saw the actual motherboard. It was really cool seeing the 
                insides of a computer and seeing the motherboard. The motherboard reminded me of Lego Land for some reason with all the squares 
                and rectangles and the green color.

                THis week we learned about Bio Engineering and we also made a prosthetic hand. I had a really fun time creating and planning the 
                prosthetic hand, we used string to bend the fingers and cut the cardboard to create flexibility. We had some trouble with the thumb
                because it wasn't big enough and it was placed awkwardly. It ended up working out though and pickinhg up the plastic water bottle 
                like expected. We were also taught the reason why scientists study mantis shrimp and geckos and honestly it really intrigued me how
                the strength of mantis shrimp releases heat and power in light form.

                This week we were taught about Aerospace Engineering, which I am also very interested in pursuing. It interests me because I have 
                always been curious about whats in our solar system and even beyond and honestly I love stars. I think I would have a great time 
                engineering rockets or space shuttles or even anything that goes into space because of all the things you need to take in account
                for. Also, I just finished designing my rocket on TinkerCad and I am excited to collaborate with my partner and work on our rocket 
                together. I cannot wait till we actually test ot our water bottle rocket by pressurizing it and seeing how far it travels.

                This week my partner and I built our own bottle rocket that we would launch. We spent all of Tuesday designing and building 
                our rocket. We used cardboard to make elliptical wings, paper for the triangle that would help the rocket pierce the air, 
                and hot glue to stick everything together. When testing, we filled up the water bottle with 1/3 water and we pressurized it with 
                50 psi. I am pretty happy with the result because our bottle rocket traveled the second farthest and even did a flip in the air.

              10/23/23-10/27/23 Week 10
              I learned that environmental engineering consisted of creating clean land, air, and water and each one of those has its own 
              subsections. We also had a water clarification project and our goal was to try our best to turn black and contaminated water 
              into the clearest water possible. We had the materials of cotton balls, sand, pebbles, and rocks ad it was our responsibility to
              choose what order these materials go into and how much of each was to be used. My partner and I put equal amounts of everything 
              and layered it as cotton balls as the bottom, sand, pebbles, and the big rocks on top. After 4-5 circulations, our water turned out 
              to be a clearish yellow, so better than the black and nasty water it was before.

              10/30/23-11/3/23 Week 11
              This week we were introduced to Electrical Engineering. We learned about circuits, resistors, diodes, anodes and cathods and
              what they each are or do. We also had to complete two labs on tinkercad to demonstrate a parallel circuit or a series circuit. 
              With a parallel circuit, our task was to place LEDS parallel to each other and make the circuit work. A series circuit on the 
              other hand, we had to put the LEDS right next to each other consecutively. I enjoyed doing this because it was like a puzzle 
              that I had to figure out.

              11/6/23-11/10/23 Week 12
              This week we constructed circuits in real life using a breadboard along with wires, resistors, and LEDS. Doing this really helped 
              me better understand how a circuit works, especially that I have to ground the wire to the negative in order for it to actually 
              light up the LED. Eventually, we used a coding program called Arduino in order to program certain patterns into the circuits. My 
              partner and I figured out how to do the first pattern, and it was cool seeing the LEDS follow our code. On the other hand, the second
              pattern would not work, turns out the program itself was acting wonky so we will try again this week.

               This week we completed Lab 4 in the Electrical Engineering Unit, I had some fun towards the end by trying to program my own pattern 
               onto the circuit. We also moved on into the Business Engineering unit. It is a mixture between knowledge in engineering 
               or technology along with the skill of pitching an idea to customers. Business engineers need to account for ethics of morals, for 
               example the trolley problem. Should the trolley run over the 5 people it is originally headed to? Or should it change direction and
               run over the 1 person on the other track. For this unit, we are coming up with our own invention and pitching it to the class. So far, 
               we have thought of a jacket that warms you up or a way to never lose your pair of socks.

        11/27/23-12/1/23 Week 14
        This week we did a project on Business Engineering, we were challeneged to come up with a product and pitch it to the class. It was kind 
        of like a Shark Tank episode, so my team and I decided to create a cooking pot wuth 2-4 dividers in it so it would allow the cook to 
        cook different foods at the same time. We did research on the material of the product, the cost of manufacturing it, and the target customers
        and with that information we created a presentation. Ours went pretty well, but among my classmates I actually really liked my friend Emma's 
        idea of an app that can connect you with scholarships and internships out there. This unit was fun but I definitely don't think I would like 
        to pursue this as a career option.

<li>What was the weight of your bridge? The weight of my bridge was 70 grams. </li>
<li>What was the weight held by my bridge? The weight held by my bridge was 3408 grams.</li>
<li>What was the ratio of weight of bridge to weight held? The ratio between weight held from the bridge to weight of the bridge itself 
was 49.</li>
<li>What was the heaviest part of your bridge? What contributed most to the weight? The heaviest part of our bridge was the middle. The thick 
portions of spaghetti noodles contributed most to the weight of my bridge.</li>
<li>Where did the design of your bridge come from? Inspiration? Research? The design of our bridge came from my group and I researching the 
best way to build the bridge. We saw a lot of triangles holding up the bridge where actual cars drive on so we incorporated that. We 
also wanted to use all of our spagetti noodles to reinforce each triangle so that is what we did.</li>
<li>Did the design work as intended? Better? Worse? The design of our bridge worked better than intended. We thought it would snap at first
but it actually held more water than expected.</li>
<li>What was the point of failure of your bridge? Was that the expected weakest point? The point of failure of our bridge was the very middle. 
It held up till almost the whole water bucket. That was the expected weakest point since it had no support under it.</li>
<li>What can you do to improve your bridge? What can prolong points of failure? We can improve our bridge by adding support under the 
rectangular bottom part of the bridge. We can prolong the failure points by incorporating more triangles onto our bridge to add more 
support.</li>

    SEMESTER 2
    
    1/8/24-1/12/24 Week 1 
    We spent half the week making up any missing work and inputting our website entry since the ransomware attack. On Thursday though, we started
    learning about chemical engineering and what fields you could go into with this degree. I was surprised to learn just how broad this field was. 
    You could use a chemical engineering degree to go into oil companies, food companies, skincare companies, and even the pharmecutical field. 
    We also tried making oobleck, all we had was a cup of cornstarch and a cup of water. My teammate and I added the full cup of cornstarch and 
    half the cup of water. I mixed it with my hands for a solid minute and we eventually did it: when I moved it around into a ball it was solid 
    but then it acted like a liquid when the motion from my hands stopped. It was quite messy but it was definitely fun.

    1/15/23-1/19/24 Week 2 
    This week my partner and I started doing some research for our mousetrap car and we also completed our project proposal. In order to 
    complete this we had to conduct some research on materials of the car such as the number of wheels it should have, how long the string should
    be, and how long the actual car should be. As for our design, we are thinking of priortizing the distance the car travels over its speed, 
    since we are getting graded on how far it goes. We are not too sure of how exactly our project will look like but we already know for sure 
    that we want to incorporate some way or mechanism that will stabalize the wheels of the car. We also watched a Mark Rober video on how to 
    contrsuct a mousetrap car and I learned about mechanical advantage, which is something we will need to calculate.

1/22/24- 1/27/24 Week 3
So far the process of building our mousetrap car is going along well since we have completed everything on time, especially the TinkerCad
of our design. At first, my partner and I were a little confused on how exactly we could calculate the distance our car was expected to travel
but we understood eventually. The worksheet we did together gave us a more insight and clarity on the whole thing. Right now our design is
estimated to travel 40 feet and we we will also start constructing this week. Our first phase of building will consist of getting the base done,
including the base for the moustrap and the two legs for the wheels.

    1/29/24-2/3/24 Week 4
    Our mousetrap car is in the process of being completed, at least the first prototype. We are basically putting together all the pieces 
    and testing it out along the way. We can see that our wheels are pretty wobbly but we already have ideas on how we can stabalize them for 
    our final prototype. We also used fishing wire for our string that rotates the axle which in turn moves our wheels forward, but the fishing
    wire is hard to tie and hard to see in general. So for our final build, we will either be using yarn or dental floss. Our first build 
    showed us that we do understand the mechanics of the mousetrap car and we can build our project. We just need to be neater and more accurate 
    with our builds of our car.

        2/5/24-2/9/24 Week 5+6
        1. The flaw in our design was how unstable the wheels were. The wheels had too much freedom to move around in. Also, the axles 
        themselves were crooked, forcing the wheels to go to the right. We also used the wrong kind of thread to rotate our back axles. The 
        string we used was kind of rough, which would get stuck when unrolling itself. 
        2. To improve the distance traveled, we will be using dental floss as the thread because it is more slippery and moves smoothly around
        the axle. We will also be adding pieces of straw around the wheel, limiting the amount of room it can wiggle around in. We will also
        add hot glue to the connection between the straw and the wheel on the outside, not the inside. This is so the wheel stays straight and 
        is stabilized. 
        3. The measured distance of our first design was 20 feet when we tested it. 
        4. Our percent error is 50%. (40-20)/20*100% = 50%
        5. So far, we have tested out this boxy body of the moustrap car. We made the body this way thinking it would help stabilize the 
        wheels by giving them something to lean on to go straight. In reality, the sides of the box were just unecessary and complicated 
        things. We also used the thinner axles thinking they would be easier to control over the thicker ones. These actually gave us more
        probelms because they weren't as strong. For example, the axle on our mousetrap would snap when pulling back the string to move 
        the car forward. We tested our first car all together and it did okay. We think it definitely would have traveled farther if we paid
        more attention to detail. 
        6. The next steps for us are doing some more research online and looking at our first protoype to identify our mistakes and how to fix
        them. We will definitely be dropping the boxy body and moving towards a flat and more sustainable body. We will also be stabilizing
        the wheels and the rod as well.

        2/19/24-2/23/24 Week 7
        Testing went pretty decent, in the sense where it traveled the exact amount of feet we calculated in the beginning. We saw what
        we expected and our second prototype was definitely better than our first. Between each build, my partner and I each did some more 
        research on our own to figure out how to stabilize the wheels, make the body more sturdy, and how to roll the string around the 
        axle so it can unroll by itself. Our car traveled 40 feet and it went pretty straight until towards the end it started leaning 
        a bit more to one side. If I had more time, I would have changed the length of our rod and the length of our string. I would change 
        both of these because I wanted the car to travel farther. And I think we could have done this if we increased the length of those
        two things to accodomate for the distance to be traveled. Our car was sturdy, and ran well, but only had enough string to travel 
        40 feet. Overall, I am happy with the project though.

        2/26/24-3/1/24 Week 8
        For our egg drop design, we researched different ways to build our design, such as using straws or utilizng a parachute. 
        We think our straw design is going to work because the ends will take most of the impact and the egg will be protected from force. So 
        far we have started to build the bottom portion of the triangular prism. We only finished the bottom part last week and intend to finish
        the whole thing this week. As for the doors and wheels challenge, we included our definition of doors and split up into groups to count
        almost each building/area on the CV campus. In total we counted around 22,000 doors on campus, which included doors, windows, lockers,
        chromebooks, anything that opened basically.

        3/4/24-3/8/24 Week 9 
        Since last week, my partner and I have added walls and cotton balls into our project in order to further project the egg during the drop. 
        Our last day of building we plan to make sure the egg is strapped in and our parachute works. My partner and I are splitting work evenly. 
        Usually she cuts me tape and I place the tape onto our project, or the other way around. Additionally, this week we did a flying paper
        challenge. Mine did not go that far because it turned right and glided down, but my design was a cylinder.

        1. Our egg drop design did work and I think the straws and cotton balls taking most of the impact saved our egg from being droppped. 
        If we had more time we would have made the design neater and more organized.

        5. Our team did good since our waterballon survived. We built a triangular prism with string and popsicles. We then attached this to
        the meter stick and ran with it. Our ballon did not fall off so it did not pop.

        1. We started a new project where we need to complete the challenge of maiing sure our boat stays afloat for the distance traveled. We
        are approaching the problem by looking at ideas on the web to help us come up with our own design. We expect success out of our project
        in the sense it stays afloat and even glides smoothly over the water.

        3. The requierements for our project is it has to stay above the water the whole time and not sink. Also, the gutter where it will be 
        travelling is eight inches wide so the width of our boat cannot be within an inch of that width.
