            8/21/23-8/24/23 Week 1 <br>
             This week I learned how to use what I learned in Physics last year about momentum and speed and apply it to a challenge. <br>
             Our challenge was to make a marble travel as long as we can make it travel for by using sticks and by not allowing for it <br>
             to move backwards, stop, or be touched by anyone's hands. We eventually got close enough to the bucket and the marble    <br>
             almost went in. I also learned how to code a bit because we had to make our own websites and code it to look the way we <br>
             want it to. I learned various controls in order to add a header, add a indent in a paragraph, etc. I had a lot of fun this <br>
             week especially since I like the hands on work.

             8/28/23-9/1/23 Week 2 <br>
             This week I learned how to use the website TinkerCad. It is a website that lets us design and computer generate our plans  
             for whatever project we are doing. For our challenege today, we had to create a home appliance using the shapes and controls. 
             So I had to flatten out shapes, add text, rotate the shapes, and manuever the things in general so I could create the buttons 
             on a microwave. I had a lot of fun using TinkerCad since it lets me be creative and I feel smart CAD'ing.

            9/5/23-9/8/23 Week 3 <br>
            This week my team and I designed our first engineering project on TinkerCad. We had to make it to scale and that was when we 
            realized our project will end up being pretty big. My team and I also started constructing our project that we hope will pop 
            a ballon as the end goal. We made measurmentsm using a ruler before cutting the cardboard pieces out so we knew we were making 
            the most of our materials. I had a lot of fun becasue I like the hands on work in this class and the collaborativeness it promotes.

            9/11/23-9/15/23 Week 4 <br>
            This was the week we tested our Rube Goldberg design project. We are pretty excited because it worked and the car did fall into 
            the see-saw pushing the needle up and popping the balloon. At first, our project did not pop the balloon because our needle was 
            too far and back and the ballon was not blown up enough. The construction of our project was also fun because we had to cut out 
            all the pieces from cardboard and use duct tape to put them together. I had a good time working with my team and we were all 
            very cooperative.

                9/18/23-9/22/23 Week 5 <br>
                I learned about Electrical Engineering in class today and I am actually interested it. With the coding we have done in class with
                our websites I feel more comfortable with it everyay and I enjoy it. On Tuesday we also did some challenges, a flotation device
                challenege and then a designing challenege. I made my boat with a base and rafters on the bottom and it actually floated
                for the full 5 minutes. We also designed the letter E to ensure we could give correct and accurate measurements.

                9/25/23-9/29/23 Week 6
                This week we took apart a computer and identified the parts. We had to be realy careful and make sure nothing was broken or 
                damaged. We took out the fan, the GPU and the Disk Drive before we saw the actual motherboard. It was really cool seeing the 
                insides of a computer and seeing the motherboard. The motherboard reminded me of Lego Land for some reason with all the squares 
                and rectangles and the green color.

                10/2/23-10/6/23 Week 7 
                THis week we learned about Bio Engineering and we also made a prosthetic hand. I had a really fun time creating and planning the 
                prosthetic hand, we used string to bend the fingers and cut the cardboard to create flexibility. We had some trouble with the thumb
                because it wasn't big enough and it was placed awkwardly. It ended up working out though and pickinhg up the plastic water bottle 
                like expected. We were also taught the reason why scientists study mantis shrimp and geckos and honestly it really intrigued me how
                the strength of mantis shrimp releases heat and power in light form.

                10/9/23-10/13/23 Week 8
                This week we were taught about Aerospace Engineering, which I am also very interested in pursuing. It interests me because I have 
                always been curious about whats in our solar system and even beyond and honestly I love stars. I think I would have a great time 
                engineering rockets or space shuttles or even anything that goes into space because of all the things you need to take in account
                for. Also, I just finished designing my rocket on TinkerCad and I am excited to collaborate with my partner and work on our rocket 
                together. I cannot wait till we actually test ot our water bottle rocket by pressurizing it and seeing how far it travels.
